Blackjack game (21)

  - Page opens by dealing out cards to yourself and dealer
  - Press hit to add a random card
  - If you exceeded 21 it wont let you hit
  - Press stay if you are content with the cards you have
  - Once stay is hit the game will display your number
  - As well as dealers
  - There are 3 outcomes win, lose, and push(tie)
  - To play again refresh page

Inspiration 
  
  I recently started playing blackjack games on my mobile
  device and was fasinated how a simple game can be so fun to 
  play i wanted to take a jab at creating my own.

Bugs/Unfinished functionality

  - As far as unfinished goes i couldnt seem to figure out why
  at times the page loads with the dealer having multiple
  cards showing and at times one. I'd like to figure out how to always 
  keep it at one card displaying.
  
  -Also I didnt keep the score updating in real time and also make the game  
  automatically display a bust when you go over 21 and not require you to hit 
  the stay button.
